          "text": "Although Marijuana is still illegal at a federal level the number of States that are allowing its use is quickly increasing. As a business owner you do not want your employees showing up for work high or intoxicated. The problem is that drug testing of employees is regulated at the State level. So if you wish to test your employees or prospective employees you will need to check your State statutes concerning the testing of employees.
Employers should note that they do not have to allow on the job use or intoxication. This includes States where they can not fire or refuse to hire a worker simply for being a registered medical-marijuana user. 
Testing for drug impairment while driving is difficult due to the limitations of drug testing technology. There also is not an agreed-upon limit to determine impairment. The nationally recognized level of impairment for drunken driving is .08 g/mL blood alcohol concentration. But there is no similar national standard for other types of drugs such as marijuana.

          "text": "Since the sale of Cannabis is still illegal at the Federal level there are no Federal guidelines concerning the level of security you must have.
Since cannabis legalization has been enacted at a state level, state cannabis security regulations do exist. Most States have extensive guidelines that are similar to Federal requirements for the storage and sale of prescription drugs. It is also important to remember that this is currently a strictly cash business and as such raises additional security concerns. As each State is different you will have to do further research to determine exactly what requirements are needed.
Below are some of the most common requirements, but again these are just a general guide and are not to be relied upon as what your business needs:
You must take calculated measures to deter and prevent unauthorized entrance into areas containing marijuana. This includes who has access to the building.
In order to apply for marijuana licensing, you will need to provide a documented security plan.
If there is a loss, theft or breech of the premises the regulatory agency of the State must be notified, usually within a specified time frame.
Licensed premises must have a video surveillance system. They need to be of high quality and have coverage of all areas of the premises where product is stored or available. There also needs to be sufficient storage of the recorded images as well, such as a high capacity NVR (network video recorder).
There needs to be a safe room where inventory is stored that meets the State guidelines.
Storefront businesses typically require security personnel during at least the hours of operation, and, in some circumstances, 24/7.
There must be an alarm system that has central monitoring.
It is important to remember that these security measures also offer you and you employees protection from robbery, so it is important to take this seriously.

          "text":"Since almost all sales are in cash, and a high value inventory is stored on the premises, you need to have a security plan. Most States have regulations about how your inventory must be secured. The cash and inventory makes your business a prime target for crime. Even if and when Federal law is changed to allow access to the banking system you will still need a security plan for your business. A safe room is a necessity. You will need to contact a local security company to formulate a comprehensive security plan to protect your employee's and your assets."

          "text":"Armored trucks are the vehicle of choice in the cannabis related industry. They are used to transport product and funds to and from the dispensary. Like bank armored cars, they are typically driven by armed guards. Because marijuana is still federally illegal, the cannabis industry does not have access to banking options that other businesses do, so armed guards are necessity.

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text":"Mold Resistant Hybrid Strains are created by breeding two or more cannabis strains. Most hybrids will have a mix of Indica and Sativa genetics. Crossbreeding helps to create a mold resisting strain by mixing different strains to enhance there mold resistance properties. There are currently a number of available hybrid strains that are resistant to mold.

A.M.S is the acronym for anti-mold-strain. It is the result of crossbreeding different strains. The result is a strain that is hardy, durable and mold resistant. These strains do extremely well in both indoor and outdoor conditions without much effort from the grower. They are especially prized for their mold-resistant properties. This gives growers protection during the critical flowering and storage periods.

These all must be linked to a central monitoring station for the best protection.
